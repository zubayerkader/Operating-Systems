# Simple-Unix-Shell
* Developed a shell that accepts user commands and executes them in a separate process.
* Used fork() and exec() system calls to create a child process and execute any unix command.
* Implemented internal commands such as pwd, cd, exit and history; also handled the SIGINT signal to display history.
